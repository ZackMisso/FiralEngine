FIRAL GAME ENGINE

This is the repository for the Firal Game Engine, a minimalistic game engine
with a real time ray tracer for the rendering. This engine is not scoped to
ever become a commercial engine, nor will it probably ever produce a high
quality game. This engine is just a cool side project and is maintained by
Zack Misso.

This project is currently so early in its lifespan I do not know where I am
going with it yet. Soon I will populate this readme with a list of current,
planned, and in progress features as well as a description of what you can
do with it.

Currently this engine is only compatible with linux until my cmake skills
improve. Until then you can build and run the engine by using the following
commands:

git clone --recursive ...blah...
cd FiralEngine
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./firal
